JPGtoPNGconvert.py does what it says it will: it converts JPG images to PNG images. PNG images are usually preferred for web applications and graphic design because they support transparency. The images used for practice were those of Pokemon.<br>
<br>
In writing this program, I practiced the following skills:
- using sys.argv in the `sys` module
- looping through a directory with the `os` module
- opening a file, splitting the filename from its extension, then saving converted copies in a new folder
<br>

These skills also enable me to loop through photo folders to resize images, such as in the case when thumbnails need to be made for a website.
